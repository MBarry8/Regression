1. Introduction

The primary goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various features in the dataset. We used linear regression as our baseline model, followed by further experimentation with data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and model evaluation. This project showcases hands-on experience with regression tasks, feature transformation, and model evaluation.

2. Dataset

The data consists of two files:

train.csv: Contains the training data, including the target variable, SalePrice.
test.csv: Contains the test data for predictions. (No SalePrice column).
Both files contain numerous features describing the properties of each house. The target variable is the SalePrice.

3. Preprocessing Steps

To ensure the dataset is ready for model training, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

Step 1: Handling Missing Values
Identify Missing Values: Checked each column for missing values.
Imputation: Filled missing values in numerical columns with the median and categorical columns with the mode.
Step 2: Encoding Categorical Features
Since machine learning models require numeric input, categorical variables were transformed into numeric features:

One-Hot Encoding: Converted categorical columns to numerical columns using one-hot encoding. This created binary columns for each unique category, allowing the model to interpret these as distinct features.
Aligning Test Data: Ensured that train.csv and test.csv had the same columns after encoding.
Step 3: Feature Scaling (Optional)
For models that benefit from scaled data, scaling was applied using StandardScaler. However, this step was deemed unnecessary for the initial linear regression model.

4. Experiments and Model Selection

Experiment 1: Baseline Linear Regression
Objective: Establish a baseline model to understand initial performance.
Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical features using one-hot encoding.
Model: Used Linear Regression.
Evaluation: Evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Results: This experiment gave us a baseline RMSE, which helped in evaluating the impact of further experiments.

Experiment 2: Polynomial Regression
Objective: Capture potential non-linear relationships in the data.
Preprocessing: The same as Experiment 1, but with polynomial feature expansion (degree = 2).
Model: Polynomial Regression (with linear regression on polynomial features).
Evaluation: Evaluated using RMSE on the validation set.
Results: Polynomial features improved the modelâ€™s ability to fit more complex patterns, but also risked overfitting. This experiment informed us of the trade-off between model complexity and overfitting.

Experiment 3: Random Forest Regressor
Objective: Test an alternative model that handles complex data patterns without requiring manual feature engineering.
Preprocessing: The same as previous experiments.
Model: Random Forest Regressor, which captures non-linear relationships effectively without extensive preprocessing.
Evaluation: RMSE on the validation set.
Results: Random Forest performed better than linear regression models, reducing RMSE and demonstrating robustness to different feature types and scales.

5. Results and Evaluation

The experiments provided insights into different approaches for predicting house prices. The Random Forest Regressor emerged as the most effective model, demonstrating lower RMSE than linear and polynomial regression models. RMSE was used as the primary evaluation metric, as it penalizes larger errors more heavily, aligning well with the goal of accurate price prediction.
